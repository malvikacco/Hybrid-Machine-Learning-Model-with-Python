Hybrid machine learning models combine different types of algorithms to leverage their unique strengths, which results in improved predictive performance and robustness.

When to Build a Hybrid Machine Learning Model?

--> A hybrid machine learning model can be when a single algorithm cannot capture data complexity. Different data types or patterns may require this. For example, using a hybrid approach when handling sequential patterns and broader trends in the data.

--> Combine models like LSTM for sequence learning and Linear Regression for trend analysis to improve performance.

--> Identify the need for a hybrid model when single models perform poorly based on performance metrics. Different models combined can provide unique strengths in predictive modeling.
